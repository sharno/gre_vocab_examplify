<div class="pagebreak"><b>Hypochondriac</b>: a person obsessed with health; having imaginary illnesses<em>hypochondriacally, adverb Hypochondriac comes ultimately from the Greek word hypokhondria, which literally means “under the cartilage (of the breastbone).” In the late 16th century, when hypochondriac first entered the English language, it referred to the upper abdomen.  The upper abdomen, it turns out, was thought to be the seat of melancholy at a time when the now-outdated medical theory of the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile [choler], and black bile [melancholy]) was accepted as a basis for legitimate health practice. In the 17th century, hypochondriac referred to people who suffered from “depression and melancholy without cause,” though we might suppose from the name of this malady that many depressed patients complained of abdominal pains, which otherwise went undiagnosed. “Vapors,” another archaic disorder connected to the upper abdomen, was used as a euphemism for PMS in a time when such things were not discussed in polite conversation. Because doctors were male at this time, “women’s problems” were largely written off as fits of hysteria (another obsolete medical term of Greek origin, from the word for womb).  It wasn’t until the 19th century that hypochondriac described someone who suffered “illness without a specific cause.” This sense is still widely used, though today we diagnose modern hypochondriacs by their overuse of the website WebMD. —The Hypochondriac: Molière’s last play, first performed in 1673.

<div class="pagebreak"><b>Dilemma</b>: puzzling situation<em>dilemmatic        [dil-uh-mat-ik]  /ˌdɪl əˈmæt ɪk/  (Show IPA), dilemmatical, dilemmic, adjective dilemmatically, adverb 1. See predicament. 2. question, difficulty. The word dilemma combines di-, a prefix meaning "two," with lemma, meaning "a proposition, theme, or subject." Our world is filled with propositions, themes, and subjects—matters about which we have to make a variety of decisions as we move through life. If we are forced to make a choice between two courses of action, or between doing something and not doing it, and if neither choice is a good one, we are in a dilemma in its primary sense—faced with a double bind, caught between Scylla and Charybdis, trapped between a rock and a hard place, and truly on the horns of a dilemma. As we can see, the sense of dilemma that deals exclusively with two unpleasant alternatives is powerful enough to have engendered a good deal of descriptive language over the years. But in today’s complex environment, if people tell you they are in a dilemma, you cannot be sure that their problem is restricted to two choices. They may be facing a situation of much greater complexity. While the first meaning is still the most common, the broadening of dilemma to include this more general sense of "any difficult or perplexing situation or problem," is an example of normal language growth. The first meaning of dilemma, involving two choices, remains alive and well. But this broader meaning is not only common and acceptable, it is found in multiple examples of educated writing.</em><ul><li>With concerts and plays the intermission often proves a bit of dilemma.</li><li>I had stated her husband's dilemma clearly, I believed fairly.</li><li>The submerged middies were now in a dilemma they had not dreamed of.</li><li>Actually, the issue of plural vs. singular is orthogonal to the dilemma she wants to pose.</li><li>This I had not heard, and in my dilemma I went to him to impart my plans and ask advice.</li></ul></div>

<div class="pagebreak"><b>Maverick</b>: a loner<em>The term maverick surged in popularity, propelled by the presidential bid in the late 2000s of US Senator John McCain, then considered a “political maverick” of the Republican Party. Given the word's Wild West roots, maverick has always had an edgy, rebellious connotation: it originally referred to unbranded cattle that strayed from the herd, putting their ownership in doubt. It was then a short step in going from this original meaning to applying the word to a person who strayed from and did not follow the thinking of a group he or she belonged to, or who rebelled against accepted ideas or to a herd mentality. Maverick thus came to generally mean an individualistic and independent thinker. In popular culture, as exemplified in the movies Maverick (1994) and Top Gun (1986), the term often describes colorful gamblers and risk takers. Depending on context, then, maverick can be applied to a pioneer who bucks current trends, or to a wild and potentially reckless loose cannon. —Dallas Mavericks: American professional basketball team based in Dallas, Texas, a member of the National Basketball Association (NBA). —Maverick: popular American TV series (1957–62) set in the Wild West that inspired a film of the same name (1994). —Maverick: Nickname and call sign of ace fighter pilot, played by Tom Cruise, in the film Top Gun (1986). —Ford Maverick: Stylish, youthfully designed mid-size car made in the late 1960s and ‘70s in North America and Brazil. “Gradually the term [maverick] came to mean any unbranded cattle of unknown ownership. Such animals were fair game for the first branding iron.“  —Richard W. Slatta, The Cowboy Encyclopedia (1994) “Maverick is a word which appeals to me more than misfit. Maverick is active, misfit is passive.“  —Alan Rickman (actor), “Alan Rickman's Quotes“ Facebook (2008) “The rugged individualist is too often mistaken for the misfit, the maverick, the spoilsport, the sore thumb.“  —Lewis H. Lapham, Money and Class in America: Notes and Observations on Our Civil Religion (1988) “Listen closely to maverick entrepreneurs…, and you quickly realize that they don't sound like traditional executives.“  —William C.

Flagrant, glaring, gross, outrageous, rank are adjectives suggesting extreme offensiveness. Flagrant, with a root sense of flaming or flaring, suggests evil or immorality so evident that it cannot be ignored or overlooked: a flagrant violation of the law. Glaring, meaning “shining brightly,” is similar to flagrant in emphasizing conspicuousness but usually lacks the imputation of immorality: a glaring error in computing the interest. Gross, which basically signifies excessive size, is even more negative in implication than the foregoing two terms, suggesting a mistake or impropriety of major proportions: a gross miscarriage of justice. Outrageous describes acts so far beyond the limits of decent behavior or accepted standards as to be totally insupportable: an outrageous abuse of the public trust.

<div class="pagebreak"><b>Clairvoyant</b>: psychic; mystic<em>clairvoyantly, adverb Clairvoyant literally means “clear-sighted” in French, and for nearly 200 years that is what it meant in English as well. It wasn’t until the mid-19th century that it took on the meaning of “having psychic gifts” or “seeing beyond” that it carries today.  In the 19th century, the term clairvoyant was widely used in a medical context. An especially astute doctor might be able to see a patient’s symptoms and try to make a “clairvoyant diagnosis.” While some of these doctors were legitimate and extremely skilled, the term “clairvoyant physician” was generally used to describe your typical 19th-century quack. Occasionally, these people were brought to justice. The 39th Volume of The Journal of the American Medical Association contains an article about one such court case, from 1898, in which one can find this rant: “Whether the plaintiff calls herself a medical clairvoyant, or a clairvoyant physician…matters little…it was held that she was not entitled to recover for her services, she having no license to practice medicine.”  As the meaning of clairvoyant started to shift, reference books of the time attempted to approximate the new uses of the word. The 1873 edition of The American Cyclopaedia describes a clairvoyant as someone who can see through opaque objects, therefore possessing the power to “read a book unopened, or a letter which is enclosed in a solid wood box.” Today, however, clairvoyant carries more spiritual connotations, and such skills would never be cheapened by freak-show displays like divining the text of an unopened book. Rather, the modern clairvoyant prefers only to “see” things that cannot be easily refuted by disbelieving skeptics. —The Clairvoyant: A 1934 film starring Claude Rains and Fay Wray. —The Clairvoyant Journals: A conceptual art piece (1978) by poet Hannah Weiner.

The use of flaunt to mean “to ignore or treat with disdain” (He flaunts community standards with his behavior) is strongly objected to by many usage guides, which insist that only flout can properly express this meaning. From its earliest appearance in English in the 16th century, flaunt has had the meanings “to display oneself conspicuously, defiantly, or boldly” in public and “to parade or display ostentatiously.” These senses approach those of flout, which dates from about the same period: “to treat with disdain, scorn, or contempt; scoff at; mock.” A sentence like Once secure in his new social position, he was able to flaunt his lower-class origins can thus be ambiguous in current English. Considering the similarity in pronunciation of the two words, it is not surprising that flaunt has assumed the meanings of flout and that this use has appeared in the speech and edited writing of even well-educated, literate persons. Nevertheless, many regard the senses of flaunt and flout as entirely unrelated and concerned speakers and writers still continue to keep them separate.</em><ul><li>Who is Jack Drogue to flaunt his pack and his politics under my nose!</li><li>Especially if those convictions inspire one candidate to tear off his shirt and flaunt his chiseled abs.</li><li>Bold enough to marry the most polarizing singer in the world and then flaunt him and his style of music all over her record.</li><li>If she had his report she could flaunt it in his face or–she caught her breath and smiled.</li><li>He is angry that Eugene and Pauline should flaunt their happiness in her sad eyes.</li></ul></div>

The four-syllable word equivocal is sometimes said by those not entirely familiar with it as  [ih-kwiv-uh-kuh-buh l]  /ɪˈkwɪv ə kə bəl/  (Show IPA)  as if it were a five-syllable word, equivocable.

Think “equal voices,” two or more voices in conflict over a meaning, attitude, statement, etc., resulting in ambiguity, indecision, or deception.

<div class="pagebreak"><b>Duplicity</b>: cunning; deception; double dealing<em>nonduplicity, noun 1.Deceit, guile, hypocrisy, duplicity, fraud, trickery refer either to practices designed to mislead or to the qualities that produce those practices. Deceit is the quality that prompts intentional concealment or perversion of truth for the purpose of misleading: honest and without deceit. The quality of guile leads to craftiness in the use of deceit: using guile and trickery to attain one's ends. Hypocrisy is the pretense of possessing qualities of sincerity, goodness, devotion, etc.: It was sheer hypocrisy for him to go to church. Duplicity is the form of deceitfulness that leads one to give two impressions, either or both of which may be false: the duplicity of a spy working for two governments. Fraud refers usually to the practice of subtle deceit or duplicity by which one may derive benefit at another's expense: an advertiser convicted of fraud. Trickery is the quality that leads to the use of tricks and habitual deception: notorious for his trickery in business deals. By and large, the most common sense of duplicity today is “deceitfulness.” The roots of this meaning can be found in the initial “dupl-,” from the Latin duplex, meaning twofold, or double. One can easily see how acting in double, or in two ways at different times, can be a way of deceiving or lying. The duplicitousness of our nature is evident in the widespread usage of other terms with similar roots. Should English speakers be concerned about how the popularity of such terms as “double-dealing,” “double-faced,” and “two-faced” negatively reflect upon our society? Indubitably. —“The Duplicity of Hargraves”: A short story by O. Henry, first published in 1902. —Duplicity: A 2009 spy flick starring Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. “Here duplicity passes for wit, and frankness is looked upon as folly.“  —Madame Elizabeth-Charlotte of Bavaria, Duchess d’Orléans, Memoirs of the Court of Louis XIV and of the Regency (1899) “[W]hen he saw that he had been tricked, he lost patience at the duplicity of the Florentines, and broke the peace with them.“  —Werner L.
